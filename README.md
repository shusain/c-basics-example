# c-basics-example

All the examples are in the `/src` folder you can compile a c program with "gcc" the GNU C compiler.

For example to compile then run the first test:
```
cd src        # go into src folder
gcc first.c   # compile the C program into machine code for your processor
./a.out       # run the code
```
